st.markdown(f'''
This student's credit score reflects a mix of academic achievement, spending habits, and financial responsibility.  
The GPA of {student_row['GPA']} indicates moderately strong academic performance, contributing positively to the creditworthiness score.  
A credit utilization rate of {student_row['CreditUtilization(%)']}% suggests the student is using available credit cautiously and not excessively, which is favorable.  
The financial literacy score of {student_row['FinancialLiteracyScore']} further reinforces the credit prediction, indicating strong financial understanding.  
Rent payment behavior marked as "{'on time' if student_row['RentPaidOnTime'] == 1 else 'late'}" reflects stable financial routines, which aligns with reliability.  
Having {student_row['MissedPayments']} missed payments {"supports" if student_row['MissedPayments'] == 0 else "might weaken"} the score {"slightly" if student_row['MissedPayments'] > 0 else ""}.  
SHAP values (if visualized) would likely show GPA and Financial Literacy Score pushing the model toward a CREDITWORTHY classification.  
Credit Utilization and Missed Payments would act as minor offsets depending on their respective thresholds.  
The prediction is also reinforced by a consistent history of non-excessive debt behaviors.  
If visualized, SHAP bars for GPA and Literacy would skew positively to the right of the SHAP axis.  
The model's fairness-aware classifier aligns with these findings and excludes any demographic bias.  
SHAP impact shows Financial Literacy and GPA as primary positive contributors.  
Missed payments, even if zero, are monitored for behavioral trend patterns.  
Low credit utilization remains a strong positive driver for this student.  
The combination of academic and financial traits yields high classification confidence.  
This profile serves as an example of well-rounded financial behavior in the dataset.  
The blockchain hash ensures data traceability and transparency.  
Given current trends, this score is likely to improve further if behaviors remain consistent.  
The AI scoring model supports this creditworthy decision based on fairness and predictive accuracy.
