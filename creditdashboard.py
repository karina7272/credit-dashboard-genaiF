A credit utilization rate of {util}% suggests the student is using available credit cautiously and not excessively, which is favorable.  
The financial literacy score of {lit} further reinforces the credit prediction, indicating strong financial understanding.  
Rent payment behavior marked as '{rent}' reflects stable financial routines, which aligns with reliability.  
Having {missed} missed payments {effect} the score {slight}.  
SHAP values (if visualized) would likely show GPA and Financial Literacy Score pushing the model toward a CREDITWORTHY classification.  
Credit Utilization and Missed Payments would act as minor offsets depending on their respective thresholds.  
The prediction is also reinforced by a consistent history of non-excessive debt behaviors.
